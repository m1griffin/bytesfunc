Introduction
============

The BytesFunc module provides high speed array processing functions for use with
Python 'bytes' and 'bytearray' objects. These functions are patterned after the
functions in the standard Python "operator" module together with some additional 
ones from other sources.

The purpose of these functions is to perform mathematical calculations on 
"bytes" and "bytearray" objects significantly faster than using native Python.

See full documentation at: https://bytesfunc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

If you are installing on an ARM platform such as the Raspberry Pi, see the
installation notes at the end before attempting to install from PyPI using PIP.

Function Summary
================


The compare operators used for 'ball', 'bany', and 'findindex' are examples
only, and other compare operations are available. Many functions will accept
other parameter combinations of sequences and numeric parameters. See the
details for each function for what parameter combinations are valid.

Supported Sequence Types
========================

BytesFunc supports Python native "bytes" and "bytearray" objects.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Performance
===========

Average performance increase on x86_64 Ubuntu with GCC is 600 times faster 
than native Python. Performance will vary depending on the function,  
with the performance increase ranging from 7 times to 1500 times. 

Other platforms show similar improvements.

Detailed performance figures are listed in the full documentation.

amd64 is another name for x86_64 and does not indicate the CPU brand.
armv7l is 32 bit ARM. The test hardware is a Raspberry Pi 3.
aarch64 is 64 bit ARM. The test hardware is a Raspberry Pi 4.


* The Rasberry Pi 3 tests were conducted on a Raspberry Pi 3 ARM CPU running
  in 32 bit mode. 
* The Ubuntu ARM tests were conducted on a Raspberry Pi 4 ARM CPU running in
  64 bit mode.
* All others were conducted using VMs running on x86 hardware. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation
============

Please note that this is a Python 3 package. To install using Pip, you will 
need (with Debian package in brackets):

* The appropriate C compiler and header files (gcc and build-essential).
* The Python3 development headers (python3-dev).
* Pip3 together with the corresponding Setuptools (python3-pip).

example::

	# Install from PyPI.
	pip3 install bytesfunc
	# Force install from PyPI source instead of using a binary wheel.
	pip3 install --user --force-reinstall --no-binary=:all: bytesfunc
	# Install from a local copy of the source package (Linux).
	pip3 install --no-index --find-links=. bytesfunc
	# Install a local package as a user package.
	pip3 install --user --no-index --find-links=. bytesfunc
	# Windows, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD seems to use "pip" instead 
	# of "pip3" for some reason.
	pip install bytesfunc


Newer versions of OpenBSD and FreeBSD will not install this package correctly 
when running setup.py directly. Use pip to install, even for local package
installs. Testing of this package has been changed to use only pip (or pip3)
in order to provide a common testing method for all platforms. Testing using
setup.py directly is no longer done.


Recent versions of PyPI seem to be building their own binary wheels for some 
platforms using their own infrastruction. This may result in an invalid ARM 
binary on Raspberry Pi. 

If you have difficulties, then either download the tar.gz version and install 
it locally (see the above instructions for a local install). Alternatively,
see the above example for how to force a binary install instead of using a 
wheel. There is also a bash script called "setupuser.sh" which will call setup.
py directly with the appropriate parameters. 

The setup.py file has platform detection code which it uses to pass the 
correct flags to the C compiler. For ARM, this includes the CPU type. If you
are using an ARM CPU type which is not recognized then setup.py may not
compile in SIMD features. You can experiment with modifying setup.py to add
new ARM models, but be sure that anything you try is compatible with the 
existing ones.


Installing on Linux with PIP and PEP-668
----------------------------------------
PEP-668 (PEPs describe changes to Python) introduced a new feature which can
affect how packages are installed with PIP. If PIP is configured to be 
EXTERNALLY-MANAGED it will refuse to install a package outside of a virtual
environment.

The intention of this is to prevent conflicts between packages which are 
installed using the system package manager, and ones which are installed using
PIP.

Linux distros which are affeced by this include the latest versions of Debian
and Ubuntu.

As this package is a library which is intended to be used by other 
applications, there is no one right way to install it, whether inside or 
outside of a virtual environment. Review the options available with PIP to see
what is suitable for your application.

For testing purposes this package was installed by setting the environment
variable PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES to "1", which effectively disables this
feature in PIP. 

example::

	export PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1

          On Ubuntu 23.04, the installation method has changed due to how 
          PEP-668 was implemented by Debian and how this affects "pip". 
          Some other distros may experience the same problems if they made 
          the same changes. See the README.TxT for details. 
* 3.4.0 - Added pyproject.toml file to satisfy Python 3.11 requirements.
          Updated build scripts to use python3 -m build instead of calling
          setup.py directly. Test targets were updated, Ubuntu 20.04 was 
          dropped, Ubuntu 22.10 was added, FreeBSD python version upgraded 
          to 3.9, OpenBSD upgraded to 7.2, Windows 10 Python upgraded to 3.11,
          Windows 11 Python upgraded to 3.11. Added __version__ attribute to 
          allow checking package version number at run time. Added version 
          unit test. Updated setup.py and other files to allow the version 
          number to be automatically updated from a single source at build 
          time.
* 3.3.0 - Major performance improvements for bsum through the use of SIMD and
          other optimizations. Used splint (GCC lint) on all C code and fixed
          warnings. Other than bsum, no changes in functionality.
