* 3.4.1 - Update to testing and support. There were no code. changes. 
          Ubuntu version updated to 23.04. AlmaLinux updated to 9.1. 
          Alpine Linux updated to 3.17.3. FreeBSD updated to 13.2. 
          OpenBSD updated to 7.3. 
          On Ubuntu 23.04, the installation method has changed due to how 
          PEP-668 was implemented by Debian and how this affects "pip". 
          Some other distros may experience the same problems if they made 
          the same changes. See the README.TxT for details. 
* 3.4.0 - Added pyproject.toml file to satisfy Python 3.11 requirements.
          Updated build scripts to use python3 -m build instead of calling
          setup.py directly. Test targets were updated, Ubuntu 20.04 was 
          dropped, Ubuntu 22.10 was added, FreeBSD python version upgraded 
          to 3.9, OpenBSD upgraded to 7.2, Windows 10 Python upgraded to 3.11,
          Windows 11 Python upgraded to 3.11. Added __version__ attribute to 
          allow checking package version number at run time. Added version 
          unit test. Updated setup.py and other files to allow the version 
          number to be automatically updated from a single source at build 
          time.
* 3.3.0 - Major performance improvements for bsum through the use of SIMD and
          other optimizations. Used splint (GCC lint) on all C code and fixed
          warnings. Other than bsum, no changes in functionality.
* 3.2.1 - Fixed formatting error in README.rst. 
* 3.2.0 - Update to testing and support. Tested with new releases of Ubuntu 
          22.04 and OpenBSD 7.1. Changed "simdsupport" to also report the 
          architecture the binary was compiled for. "Simdsupport" is only
          used for testing and benchmarking and is not a stable part of
          the release.
* 3.1.2 - Bump to correct minor documentation error in README.rst. 
* 3.1.1 - Update to testing and support. Raspberry Pi 32 bit OS updated to
          version 2022-04-04. Update to setup.py to improve ARM version 
          detection.
* 3.1.0 - Update to testing and support. On Windows 10 the Python version is
          3.10. Centos has been replaced by AlmaLinux due to Red Hat ending 
          long term support for Centos. Ubuntu Server 21.04 replaced by 21.10.
          No actual code changes.
* 3.0.0 - Major speed improvement to lshfit and rshift on x86-64 due to adding
          SIMD support. Debian test platforms were updated to latest versions 
          (11). 
* 2.2.0 - Updated benchmarks to make each one a separate file. Centos and
          OpenSuse test platforms updated to latest versions.
* 2.1.1 - Documentation updated and version number bumped to reflect testing 
          with Ubuntu 21.04, FreeBSD 13.0, and OpenBSD 6.9. No code changes.
* 2.1.0 - Changed setup.py to detect Raspberry Pi 4 and set the compiler args
          accordingly. Added support for Pi 4. Dropped testing of 64 bit 
          mode on Pi 3. 
* 2.0.1 - Documentation updated to reflect testing with the release version
          of Ubuntu 20.04 ARM (Rasberry Pi), Ubuntu 2010 (x86-64), OpenBSD 6.8,
          and Python 3.9 on Windows. No code changes and no change in version 
          number.
* 2.0.0 - Documentation updated to reflect testing with the release version
          of Ubuntu 20.04. No code changes and no change in version number.
* 2.0.0 - Added SIMD support for ARMv8 AARCH64. This is 64 bit ARM on a
          Raspberry Pi3 when running 64 bit Ubuntu. Raspbian is 32 bit only
          and has 64 bit SIMD vectors. 64 bit ARM has 128 bit SIMD vectors
          and so offers improved performance.
* 1.0.0 - First release.
